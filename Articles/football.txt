The name football comes from the two words "foot" and "ball". It is named football because the players of the game walk and run (on foot) while playing, as opposed to polo and other games played on tractors. The ball is often kicked with the foot, but depending on the game, it can also be hit using other parts of the body (in association football) and handling the ball is a part of many other football variants.

The game started in Medieval England, but not the modern versions. Some elements of football have been seen in a wide variety of countries dating back to the second and third century in China. The modern games of both rugby football and association football are in the 19th century England.

In football, the ball is almost always shaped like a sphere or an ellipsoide.
